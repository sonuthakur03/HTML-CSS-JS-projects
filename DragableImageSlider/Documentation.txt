#### JS documentation


### JavaScript Code:

```javascript
<script defer>
// Get necessary elements from the DOM
const wrapper = document.querySelector(".wrapper");
const carousel = document.querySelector(".carousel");
const arrowBtns = document.querySelectorAll(".wrapper .icon");
const carouselChildrens = [...carousel.children];

// Initialize variables for drag functionality
let isDragging = false;
let startX, startScrollLeft, timeoutId;

// Calculate the number of cards that fit in the carousel view
let cardPerView = Math.round(carousel.offsetWidth / firstCardWidth);

// Insert copies of cards at the beginning and end for infinite scrolling
// This ensures a seamless transition when reaching the end of the carousel
// and going back to the beginning
// Code for inserting copies of cards not shown here

// Function to handle the start of dragging
const dragStart = (e) => {
    // Record initial cursor position and carousel scroll position
}

// Function to handle dragging
const dragging = (e) => {
    // Update scroll position based on cursor movement
}

// Function to handle the end of dragging
const dragStop = () => {
    // Reset dragging flag and remove dragging class
}

// Function to handle infinite scrolling of the carousel
const infiniteScroll = () => {
    // If carousel is at the beginning or end, scroll to the opposite end
}

// Function to handle autoplay of the carousel
const autoPlay = () => {
    // Autoplay the carousel after a certain interval
}

// Event listeners for mouse events and carousel scrolling
// Code for event listeners not shown here
</script>
```

### Explanation of JavaScript Code:

1. **Variable Declarations**:
   - `wrapper`: Selects the wrapper element containing the carousel.
   - `carousel`: Selects the carousel element.
   - `arrowBtns`: Selects all navigation arrow buttons.
   - `carouselChildrens`: Converts the children of the carousel into an array for manipulation.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `isDragging`: Boolean variable to track if the carousel is being dragged.
   - `startX`, `startScrollLeft`: Variables to store the initial cursor position and carousel scroll position during dragging.
   - `timeoutId`: Stores the ID of the autoplay timeout.

3. **Card Per View Calculation**:
   - Calculates the number of cards that fit in the carousel view based on the width of the carousel and the width of the first card.

4. **Infinite Scrolling**:
   - Copies cards from the end and inserts them at the beginning of the carousel, and vice versa, to achieve infinite scrolling effect.

5. **Event Handlers**:
   - `dragStart`: Handles the start of dragging by recording initial cursor position and carousel scroll position.
   - `dragging`: Handles dragging by updating the scroll position based on cursor movement.
   - `dragStop`: Handles the end of dragging by resetting flags and removing dragging class.
   - `infiniteScroll`: Handles infinite scrolling by scrolling to the opposite end if the carousel is at the beginning or end.
   - `autoPlay`: Handles autoplay of the carousel by scrolling it after a certain interval.

6. **Event Listeners**:
   - Event listeners are added for mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) and carousel scrolling to trigger the appropriate event handlers.



### Summary:

The HTML, CSS, JS structure consists of the necessary elements to create a draggable image slider (carousel). It includes meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, a link to import Google Fonts, and a title for the webpage. The main content is wrapped inside a `<div>` element with the class "wrapper", which contains navigation arrows and a container for the carousel items.

The JavaScript code provides functionality for the image carousel, including dragging, infinite scrolling, and autoplay. It initializes variables, calculates the number of cards per view, and defines event handlers and listeners to enable user interaction with the carousel. The code ensures smooth navigation and interaction with the carousel's features.
